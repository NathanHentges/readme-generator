# Readme Generator


## Description
This program will generate a README file based on data you input.

Its goal is to streamline the process of creating a README file. 

Since many README files follow the same format, this template will help speed up that process.

After it's generated, the user can still go in and make changes.

A demonstration of the program running can be found here:
[assets/demonstration-video.mp4](assets/demonstration-video.mp4)

The resulting file can be found here [assets/generated-README.md](assets/generated-README.md).

Below is a screenshot from the video; the final result and commandline history.
